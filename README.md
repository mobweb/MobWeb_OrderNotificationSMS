# MobWeb_SMSNotifications extension for Magento

This Magento extension integrated enables the automatic sending of various notification SMS via Twilio.

Right now it supports sending a notification to the store owner when a new order is placed and a notification to a customer once a new shipment has been created for them. Easily extendable with new functionality (pull requests welcome!).

## Installation

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible.
